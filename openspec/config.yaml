schema: spec-driven

context: |
  Project: Sam (agent-samwise) — a personal assistant agent inspired by Samwise Gamgee.
  
  Tech stack: Go (Golang)
  Execution: GitHub Actions (scheduled) + local CLI
  Output: Slack messages (scheduled runs), CLI stdout (local runs)
  Configuration: YAML config file for calendars, projects, boards, etc.
  Secrets: Environment variables for API keys (Google, Todoist, Slack)
  
  Capabilities (planned):
  1. Sync Google Calendar events to a Todoist project
  2. Review Todoist projects from a kanban board and advise on next steps / blockers
  3. Review non-archived Gmail emails for items needing attention
  4. Memory system in AGENTS.md for remembering user preferences
  5. Daily calendar review — map events to projects/areas, recommend attend/skip
  
  Design principles:
  - Domain-expressive naming (no Manager/Handler/Service/Utils)
  - Value objects over primitives
  - No setters — methods that capture intent
  - Configurable via YAML, secrets via env vars

rules:
  proposal:
    - Identify which planned capability this change relates to
    - Consider both GitHub Actions and local CLI execution paths
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
    - Include scenarios for both Slack output and CLI output where relevant
  design:
    - Justify external library choices
    - Consider testability — interfaces for external APIs
  tasks:
    - Include tasks for GitHub Actions workflow where applicable
